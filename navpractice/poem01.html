		<P> There rose a tree. O pure transcendency!
			</P>
		<P>O Orpheus singing! O tall tree in the ear! </P>
			
			<P>And all was silent. Yet even in the silence</P>
			<P>new beginning, beckoning, change went on.</P>
		
		<P>Creatures of stillness thronged out of the clear</P>
		<P>released wood from lair and nesting-place;</P>
		<P>and it turned out that not from cunning and not</P>
		<P>from fear were they so hushed within themselves,</P>
		<P>but from harkening. Bellow and cry and roar</P>
		<P>seemed little in their hearts. And where before </P>
		<P>hardly a hut had been to take this in,</P>
		<P>a covert out of darkest longing</P>
		<P>with an entrance way whose timbers tremble,-</P>
		<P>you built temples for them in their hearing.
